# Sirius - A Post System Installation Script

**Sirius** is a collection of my personal system configurations and applications that I use in my personal computer. It does automatic package installations and configuration that I used to do after a fresh Fedora installation.

## Getting Started

To run this script, you will need

- Fedora 31 Workstation (x86_64)

### Running the script

Clone this repository

```bas
git clone https://gitlab.com/AlShakib/sirius.git
```

Change current directory to the repository

```bash
cd sirius
```

Run the script,

```bash
sudo ./start.sh
```

To setup gsettings settings - run,

```bash
./gsettings.sh
```

## Customization

There are few things you can customize before running the script.

### `home.edit` and `root.edit`

There are two files in the `config` directory named `home.edit` and `root.edit`. These two files contain the location of those files which are going to be edited by the script. The source file will contain in the `root` or the `home` directory. By reading those source files, the script will edit the destination file. By default the destination file has to contain the `variable = value` format. (Note the `=` delimiter.)

#### The `source` file

The source file may have following format:

- `entry=value` : If entry is already present in destination, override the value in the destination otherwise append the entry to the destination.
- `@entry|value` : Append new value to entry's value if present in destination.
- `$entry=value` : Change value if and only if entry exists.
- `!entry`: Remove entry from destination.
- `>entry `: Forcefully append to destination.
- `~entry` : Uncomment an entry from the destination file. (Only # comment is supported for now.)

### Add new file to system

- The `root` directory contains all files which are going to copy or override over `/` directory. You can add or modify any file in the `root` directory. You can skip from directly being copied by adding those files to `config/root.edit`. (Note: You should not add files to `root/home/{username}/`. The home directory requires ownership of the user. If you want to add files to the home directory, follow the next instruction.)
- The `home` directory contains all files which are going to copy or override over `/home/{username}/`. You can add or modify any file in the `home` directory. You can skip from directly being copied by adding those files to `config/home.edit`.

### Add new package to package list

You can add new package to package list by editing `packages/dnf`, `packages/flathub`, `packages/npm` and `packages/pip`.

#### Package list file

The package list file will contain the name of the packages. For example, if you add `tilix` to `packages/dnf`, the script will install Tilix Terminal Emulator.

You can remove a package by adding `!` in front of the package name. For example, if you add `!tilix` to `package/dnf`, the script will remove Tilix Terminal Emulator from system.

### Add new gnome shell extensions

You can add new gnome shell extensions to `root/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions` for system level installation or `home/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions` for user level installation.

### Add new fonts

You can add new fonts to `root/usr/share/fonts` for system level font installation.

### Add new themes

You can add new themes to `root/usr/share/themes` for system level theme installation.

### Add or modify gsettings value

You can add new gsettings value or modify existing gsettings value by editing `config/gsettings`.

### Logs

After running the script, the log file can be found in the `log` directory.
